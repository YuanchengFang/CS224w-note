### Define a single layer

Two step process: 1)Message 2)Aggregation

GCN，GraphSAGE，GAT

Attention, Batch Normalization,  Dropout, Activate function

### Stacking multiple layers

The standard way: Stack GNN layers sequentially

Over-smooth problem: stack many GNN layers -> nodes will have highly overlapped receptive filed

- Increase the expressive power within each GNN layer：让shallow GNN也能有足够表达力。在aggregation function上做文章、Add layers that do not contain GNN layers
- Still need many layers? Add skip connections in GNNs

### Augmentation and manipulation

### How do we train a GNN
