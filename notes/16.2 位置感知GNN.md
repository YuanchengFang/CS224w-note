Two types of tasks on graphs: Structure-aware and Position-aware

GNN works well for structure-aware tasks.

GNN fails for position-aware tasks.

#### Anchor-sets

Select a set of nodes as anchors, we define distance to an anchor-set as **the minimum distance** to all the nodes in the ancho-set.

Anchor-sets越大，越能提供更精确的位置估计

#### How to use position information

- The simple way: use position encoding as an augmented node feature
- The rigorous (严格的) solution: 需要特殊的神经网络来维护position encoding的**排序不变性**
