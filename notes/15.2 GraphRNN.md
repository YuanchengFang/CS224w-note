#### Model Graphs as Sequences

Node-level sequence and edge-level sequence

- Generate a state for a new node (node-level)
- Generate edges for the new node based on its state (edge-level)

#### GraphRNN

GraphRNN has a **node-level RNN** and an **edge-level RNN**.

- Node-level RNN generates the initial state for edge-level RNN
- Edge-level RNN sequentially predict if the new node will connect to each of the previous node.
