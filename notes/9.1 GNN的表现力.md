How powerful are GNNs? What is the expressive power (ability to distinguish different graph structure)?

#### Local Neighborhood Structures

We consider local neighborhood structures around each node in graph.

关键问题：GNN的node embeddings能区分不同的Local Neighborhood Structures吗？

Computational Graph可以决定一个node的embeddings，大多数有表现力的GNN能将不同的Computational Graph结构映射到不同的嵌入向量

#### Brief Summary

Expressive GNN need to **fully retain neighboring information**. in other words, most expressive GNN would use an **injective neighbor aggregation**.
