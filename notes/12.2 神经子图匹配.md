### Neural Subgraph Representation

Given a large **target** graph (can be disconnected) and a **query** graph (connected)

Decide is a **query** graph a subgraph in the **target** graph?

#### Isomorphism as a ML Task

Use GNN to predict subgraph isomorphism

Given target graph and query graph, return True or False.

##### Decompose into neighborhoods

##### Node-anchored

#### Order Embedding Space

Subgraph isomorphism relationship can be nicely encoded in order embedding space. Transitivity, anti-symmetry, closure under intersection

$G_1$的embedding如果在$G_2$的右上方，则$G_2$是$G_1$的子图。且注意到所有embedding非负。

###### Loss Function: max-margin loss

$$
E(G_q, G_t) = \sum_{i=1}^D (\max(0, z_q[i] - z_t[i]))^2
$$

E > 0 if $G_q$ is not subgraph of $G_t$

E = 0 if $G_q$ is subgraph of $G_t$

对于正样本：Minimize E

对于负样本：Minimize $\max(0, \alpha - E)$

Positive examples: Use BFS sampling

Negative examples: removing/adding edges

At every iteration, we sample new training pairs.

Usually use 3-5 search depth, depends on size of the dataset.
