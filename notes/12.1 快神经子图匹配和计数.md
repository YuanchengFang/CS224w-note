### Subgraphs and Motifs

Subgraphs are the building blocks of graphs.

#### Definition of Subgraph

##### Def 1. Node-induced subgraph

select the nodes, determine the edges

##### Def 2. Edge-induced subgraph

select the edges, determine the nodes

Alternate terminology: "non-induced subgraph" or just "subgraph"

Which one is the best? The best definition depends on the domain! In Chemistry, it could be node-induced (functional group). In KGs, often edge-induced (focus on the edges representing logical relations)

#### Graph Isomorphism

图同构问题

A big open question, nobody knows whether is np-hard or polynomial solution.

#### Graph Isomorphism

$G_2$ is subgraph-isomorphic to $G_1$ if some subgraph of $G_2$ is isomorphic to $G_1$

两个图$G_1$$G_2$，$G_1$与$G_2$的某个子图同构，则$G_2$对$G_1$子图同构

#### Network Motifs

"Recurring, significant patterns of interconnections"

Definition:

- Pattern: Small (node-induced) subgraph
- Recurring: Found many times, i.e., with high frequency
- Significant: More frequent than expected. (More frequent than random graphs)

#### Subgraph Frequency

##### Graph-level subgraph frequency definition

##### Node-level subgraph frequency definition

#### Motif significance

##### Random graphs

- ER random graphs: create n nodes, for each pair of nodes flip a biased coin with bias p
- Configuration Model: the goal is to generate a random graph with a given degree sequence. 

##### Motif Significance Overview

Compare the real network frequency to the random graph frequency. We can use statistical measures to evaluate how significant is each motif, for example z-score
