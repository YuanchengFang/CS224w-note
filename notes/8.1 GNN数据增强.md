Raw input graph has not to be computation graph

### Graph Feature Augmentation

input graph lacks features -> feature augmentation

经典做法：

- 给节点赋常数值
- one hot, costly and expressive，hard to generalize to unseen nodes(bad at inductive learning)

其他做法：

- Certain structures hard to learn by GNN. 比如对于一个节点，GNN只看它的邻居，有时区分不了这个节点所在的图的结构，比如3元环和4元环中的节点的邻居都是两个
- more examples: node degree, clustering coefficient, PageRank, centrality

### Graph Structure Augmentation

- too sparse: Add virtual nodes / edges
- too dense: Sample neighbors when doing message passing
- too large: Sample subgraphs to compute embeddings

#### Add virtual edges

connect 2-hop neighbors via virtual edges, which is also instead of using matrix A, use $A + A^2$

#### Add virtual nodes

The virtual node will connect to all the nodes in the graph

#### Node Neighborhood Sampling

tradeoff between computational efficiency and expressive power
