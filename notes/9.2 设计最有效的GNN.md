Expressive power of GNNs can be characterized by that of **neighbor aggregation functions** they use.

#### Neighbor Aggregation

Neighbor aggregation is a function over multi-sets.

Mean and max are not expressive enough.

#### GIN

Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN). GIN's neighbor aggregation function is injective. GIN is the most expressive GNN in the class of message-passing GNNs.

#### GIN is neural network version of WL Graph Kernel

Recall: Color refinement algorithm in WL kernel

- 为每个节点赋初始颜色值

- 迭代提炼节点的颜色：

  $$c^{(k+1)}(v) = \text {HASH}(c^{(k)}(v), \{c^{(k)}(u)\}_{u\in N(v)})$$

- K次迭代后，获得$c^{k}(v)$

$$c^{(k+1)}(v) = \text {GINConv}(c^{(k)}(v), \{c^{(k)}(u)\}_{u\in N(v)})$$

#### Ranking by discriminative power

sum > mean > max
