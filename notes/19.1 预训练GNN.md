#### Challenges of Applying ML

1. 稀缺带标签的数据，机器学习模型容易对少量数据过拟合
2. out-of-distribution prediction，测试用例和训练用例截然不同，机器学习模型很难外推

A solution: Injecting Domain Knowledge. Let the model already knows the domain knowledge before training on data. So that

1. Generalize well without many labeled data.
2. Extract essential pattern that allows better extrapolation.

#### Pre-training

Pre-training is a powerful solution to the challenges above.

#### Pre-training GNNs

For the molecue classification task:

##### Naive Pre-training

Only pre-train the graph embeddings

##### Effective Pre-training

Pre-train both node and graph embeddings
