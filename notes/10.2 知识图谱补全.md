### Knowledge Graphs

Capture entities, types, and relationships

- nodes are entities
- nodes are labeled with their types
- edges between two nodes capture relationships between entities

KG is an example of a heterogeneous graph

- KG can be used in search engine to serve information
- KG can do question answering and conversation agents

Common characteristics of some KG datasets:

- massive: millions of nodes and edges
- incomplete: **many true edges are missing**

So knowledge graph completion is needed.
