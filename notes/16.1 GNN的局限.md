For a perfect GNN:

- If two nodes have the same neighborhood structure, they must have the same embedding.
- If two nodes have different neighborhood structure, they must have different embeddings.

#### Limitations

##### Position aware

Perfect GNN are not perfect enough: The position in the graph cannot be observed by GNN.

##### Cycle

Message passing GNN cannot count cycle length.

例如：GNN会为三元环和四元环的节点生成相同的embedding

#### Save Cycle Length

- A naive solution: one-hot encoding，缺点是不能scalable (可拓展的)，很难处理节点数量大的情况。还有这种做法难以inductive，embedding dim一旦确定，就无法为新增的节点改变dim
