#### Recap: Graph Generation Problem

Use graph generative model to generate synthetic graph which is similar to real graph.

#### History of Graph Generation

- Step 1: properties of real-world graph
- Step 2: Traditional graph generative models
- Step3: Deep graph generative models

#### Graph Generation Tasks

- Task 1: Realistic graph generation, generate graphs that are similar to a given set of graphs.
- Task 2: Goal-directed graph generation, generate graphs that optimize given objectives/constraints.

#### Deep Generative Model
