### Heterogeneous Graph 异质图

A heterogeneous graph is defined as 
$$
G = (V, E, R, T)
$$

- Nodes with node types $v_i \in V$
- Edges with relation types $(v_i, r, v_j) \in E$
- Node type $T(v_i)$
- Relation type $r \in R$ 

Relational GCN: we extend GCN to handle heterogeneous graphs with multiple edge/relation types

- Use different neural network weights for different relation types

### Relational GCN (RGCN):

$$
h_V^{(l+1)} = \sigma (\sum_{r\in R}\sum_{u \in N_v^r} \frac{1}{c_{v,r}}W_r^{(l)}h_u^(l) + W_0^{(l)}h_v^{(l)})
$$

$c_{v, r} = |N_v^r|$  incoming degree of the relation r to the node v

The size of each $W_r^{(l)}$ is $d^{l+1} \times d^{(l)}$, where $d^{l}$ is the hidden dimension in layer l

Two methods to regularize the weights $W_r^{(l)}$

- Block Diagonal Matrices

- Basis Learning: share weights across different relations

### Example of RGCN usage

- Entity/Node Classification

- Link prediction: for every relation type, each splits edges independently.

  Quite sophisticated
