#### Kronecker Graph

Initialize matrix $K_1$
$$
K_m = K_1^{[m]} = K_1 \otimes K_1 \otimes \dots K_1
$$
This method is deterministic. The graph is decided once $K_1$ initialized.

#### Stochastic Kronecker Graph

Use  Kronecker Graph method to generate a probability matrix, then flip coins.

#### Summary on the generative methods above

- ER
- Small world
- Kronecker

These models have prior assumption of the graph generation processes.
