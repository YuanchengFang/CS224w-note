How to perform multi-hop reasoning over KGs?

- Answering multi-hop queries: path queries, conjunctive queries
- Query2box

Queries types:

- one-hop queries
- path queries
- conjunctive queries

#### One-hop Queries

We can formulate **KG completion problems as answering one-hop queries.** I.E. Is link $(h, r, t)$ in the KG? $\Leftrightarrow$ Is t an answer to query(h, r, ?)

#### Path queries

We can generalize one-hop queries to path queries by adding more relations on the path. 
$$
q = (v_a, (r_1, \dots ,r_n))
$$
一步步按路径query

However, KGs are incomplete.

~~First do KG completion and then traverse to get the answer~~ is not a solution.

Because after completion, the KGs will be **dense**, time complexity of traversing will be huge.

The task is: Predictive queries, we need generalize one-hop link prediction to multi-hop link prediction.
