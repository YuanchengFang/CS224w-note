### Mining Frequent Subgraphs

Learned before: is the query graph a subgraph of the target graph?

We will learn: finding the most frequent size-k motifs, which requires solving two challenges:

- Enumerating all size-k connected subgraphs
- Counting occurrences of each subgraph type

Computation time grows exponentially (指数式) as the size of the subgraphs increases.

**Computationally hard:**

- Combinatorial explosion of number of possible patterns
- Counting subgraph frequency is NP-hard

**Representation learning** can tackle these challenges:

- Use the GNN to "predict" the frequency of the subgraph
- Don't enumerate subgraphs but construct a size-k subgraph incrementally

- Start with motif which only contains single node.
- Then grow the motif by iteratively choosing a neighbor in target graph.
- Upon reaching a desired motif size take the subgraph of the target graph induced by S.
