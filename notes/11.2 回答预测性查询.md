#### Traversing KG in Vector Space

Key idea: Embed queries

Given a path query:  $q = (v_a, (r_1, \dots, r_n))$

In vector space is also:  $q = v_a + r_1 + \dots + r_n$ 

This is also because TransE can naturally handle composition relations, it can handle path queries by translating in the latent space for multiple hops using addition of relation embeddings.

#### Traversing KG for Conjunctive Queries

How do we define the intersection operation in the latent space?
